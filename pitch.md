# CMSI 3801 Pitch


We have decided to work on a web scraper that, given a word and a website, can find all instances of that word and then add those instances to a database. The user can also submit multiple words for the web scraper to search for. The project will be two parts. Depending on how much time we have, we might add on other bells and whistles to our scraper, i.e. look for the first ‘x’ amount of given word… only look in a certain paragraph… look at the whole sentence containing that word. We are also thinking about making it into an application, though we are still unsure (both of us have limited experience with web app).


## Specifications


### Goals:


- Create a working and efficient web scraper
- Connect the data found in web scraper to our database
- Creating an easy-to-use tool that can be useful for research and understanding a topic
- Effective use of GitHub to collaborate on code


### Problems/Questions:


- Do we want to make it an app? Website?
- What language would we need to write our app/website?
- ChatGPT to optimize our program?


### Imports:


- MechanicalSoup
- pandas
- sqlite
- Selenium


The project will be split into several files, some involving the web scraper and others calling the database. The web scraper will be built in Python using VSCode.


The database we will be using is Firebase, stored on the Google Cloud. We will be using the free version of Firebase since we do not believe the scope of this project will require the paid version. 
If all goals are met and we still have time, we can implement ChatGPT by asking it if the information collected is relevant to the topic.
